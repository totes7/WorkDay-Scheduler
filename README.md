# WorkDay-Scheduler

## Description


The purpose of this project is to create a simple web application to help preserve daily information within a locally stored planner. The page dynamically updates the current day and time every second using Dayjs, displayed at the top. Each time block is visually differentiated with colors: gray represents past time, red signifies the present, and green denotes upcoming time for the day. This is achieved by employing an if statement to compare the current time with the specified time in each time block.
